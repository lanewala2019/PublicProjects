 WS2811 strand of 50 lights
connected female end to RPi4:
	Ground Wire at female end to GND pin on RPI4 (I used pin 39)
	Data Wire (middle wire on female connector) to GPIO18 on RPI 4(pin 12)
RPI4 powered by its own 5VDC power
WS2811 powered by its own 12VDC power:
	There are two wires hanging off the female end...
	Per the label on the WS2811 strand, RED is +, BLUE is GND...
	Connect 12VDC supply using appropriate polarity

Test program 1:

import board
import neopixel
from time import sleep
# Tell neopixels using GPIO18 to control 50 lights with desired brightness
pixels = neopixel.NeoPixel(board.D18, 50, brightness=1)
# signal the strand to turn on green only
pixels.fill((255,0,0))
pixels.show()
# Sleep for 2 seconds
sleep(2)
# Reset LEDs to OFF
pixels.fill((0,0,0))



Test program 2:

import board
import neopixel

pixels = neopixel.NeoPixel(board.D18, 50, brightness=1)
pixels.fill((0,0,0))
i = 0
j = 0
k = 0
for i in range (0, 255, 10):
	for j in range (0, 255, 10):
		for k in range (0, 255, 10):
			pixels.fill((i,j,k))
			pixels.show()
pixels.fill((0,0,0))
